## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

```bash
https://nextjs.org/learn
```

This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Memo:

[Next.js start-up documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/installation) 

+ Next can be configured for TypeScript by renaming a file to .ts or .tsx and running 'dev' -- the required TS packages will be installed
+ To create a new next.js app and automatically link with remote/master github account:
 
## TO MAKE A NEXT.JS APP

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

## TO MAKE FOLDER STRUCTURE

Default (Vite):
+ public: static assets
+ src/app: Main front-end:
  + each page folder/page
  + layout.js: global layout
  + page.js: global page/default

Optional:
+ styles (put css in here)
+ src/pages (put pages in here)
+ src/components
+ src/utils

## TO MAKE COMPONENTS

+ Navigation.js inside components folder (for nav links)
+ Header.js
+ Footer.js

## TO MAKE STYLES
+ If you make separate CSS files, import these in layout.js (you can also make a folder in src but correct layout.js import path)

## TO MAKE PAGES
Create-next will make a 'app/page.js' which is the index. Inside app folder you can then add more folders (one per new page). Next uses file-system routing, so folder structure/layout creates the nested routes. Next creates a default homepage, called app/page.tsx. Other routes and pages can branch out from it.

To create a new page, make a folder in app, and add a page.tsx/js inside. The pathname of the page will be based on the folder structure, e.g:

```bash 
app/dashboard/profile/page.tsx will be found at pathname:

www.[...]dashboard/profile
```

## SHARE GLOBAL STYLE AND COMPONENTS WITH PAGES
In react, global style is set up in the app.jsx. In Next, unless you make an _app.js page (to mimic react), style is imported into each page separately (?).

You can import global.css to any component, but by default should import it into your top-level component, which is the root layout file (layout.js/ts). Anything inside the root layout.tsx file will be shared across every page of the site. UI added to sub-folder layout.tsx files doesn't need to be put inside the root layout file.

When you make a next.js app you can opt to use Tailwind. The CSS will be part of the jsx. If you want to keep the CSS separate and customize your selectors and classes, you can use CSS modules. The css files will be called things like 'home.module.css'.

Create a module.css file (and put inside a sub-folder, e.g. app/styles). Import this into page.ts and create the element bracketing the filename. For instance, inside your module.css file add a class:

```bash
.shape {
  height: 0;
  width: 0;
  border-bottom: 30px solid black;
  border-left: 20px solid transparent;
  border-right: 20px solid transparent;
}
```

Then where you want this element to go, write:

```bash 
<div className={styles.shape} />
```

### Class state toggling:

You can npm install clsx and use to apply conditional classes based on state. For instance inside a page.ts:

```bash
import clsx from 'clsx';

      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
```

Other css you can use with Next:
+ Sass (scss files)
+ CSS-in-JS (styled-jsx, styled-components, emotion)

## SHARING LAYOUT BETWEEN PAGES

Anytime you want to share layout between pages, you can make a layout.tsx page to bring in shared components, e.g. a navbar, header, footer, etc. Anything that will display on multiple pages.

In this app, the components are stored inside app/ui/dashboard.

### Create Links
To link between pages use next's in-built <Link /> component. Import Link into your nav-links (or other link) component. Here, that is inside app/ui/dashboard/nav-links.tsx.

## TO SET UP A DB

Next.js can work serverless (it has built-in next-start server support). Vercel provides dbs: 
(1) first deploy on Vercel;
(2) Navigate to your app's dashboard;
(3) Navigate to 'storage' tab and choose a db (e.g. Neon Vercel Postgres);
(4) Once db is connected, 'show secret' under .env.local and 'copy snippet';
(5) Paste this into an .env file in your code editor
(6) in code editor terminal run:

```bash
npm i @vercel/postgres
```

to install the Vercel Postgres SDK.

## TO DEPLOY

### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## TO SET UP A DB

Next.js can work serverless (it has built-in next-start server support). Vercel provides dbs: 
(1) first deploy on Vercel;
(2) Navigate to your app's dashboard;
(3) Navigate to 'storage' tab and choose a db (e.g. Neon Vercel Postgres);
(4) Once db is connected, 'show secret' under .env.local and 'copy snippet';
(5) Paste this into an .env file in your code editor
(6) in code editor terminal run:

```bash
npm i @vercel/postgres
```

to install the Vercel Postgres SDK.

## SEEDING THE DB

There is a seed file inside app/seed. To seed the db, visit:

```bash
 localhost:3000/seed
 ```

## FETCHING DATA

You need an API to fetch your data, either from 3rd party services, or to fetch data from your app's client.

This app queries db using Vercel Postgres SDK and SQL. The query file is at app/lib/data.ts

### Loading

This app contains a loading skeleton - loading.tsx - which is a placeholder sent to client and rendered while the page content is loading.

### Suspense

Suspense allows you to defer rendering parts of an application until a condition is met. Components can be wrapped in Suspense, which is passed as a fallback component until the condition is met.
